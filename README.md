# Contract-Review-with-Transformers
- This project uses two hugging face models named distilbert base v4 and albert base v4 to help determine whether the hypotheses about the document is entailed, contradicts or is neutral.
- The dataset link : https://stanfordnlp.github.io/contract-nli/
- So far 90% accuracy is reached, could achieve more by balancing the dataset, increasing the number of samples.
- Distilbert and Albert are used as potential models for contract Review.
